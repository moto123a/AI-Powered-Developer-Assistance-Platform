const FAQS = [
  { q: "Can the interviewer detect CoopilotX?", a: "No. The stealth overlay is built specifically to be invisible to screen-share on Zoom, Teams, Meet, and Webex. It doesn't appear in recordings either. We have tested this extensively." },
  { q: "Does it work for HireVue and one-way video interviews?", a: "Yes. HireVue uses your microphone and webcam. CoopilotX works at the system audio level, so it captures the questions whether they're read aloud by the platform or by a human interviewer." },
  { q: "What if the answer isn't right?", a: "Every answer is grounded in your resume, so it will always reference your real experience. If a specific answer doesn't fit, ignore it and use your own words. Think of it as a live outline, not a script." },
  { q: "Do I need the desktop app, or can I use the browser?", a: "For mock practice, the browser is perfect. For real interviews, we strongly recommend the desktop app. It uses system audio capture which gives you true stealth. The browser version requires microphone access which can occasionally trigger platform warnings." },
  { q: "Is my data safe?", a: "Your audio never leaves your device. Raw audio is processed locally. Only the text transcript is sent to the LLM for answer generation, and that's discarded after each response. We don't store conversation history or sell your data." },
  { q: "How is this different from just Googling answers?", a: "Every answer is generated in real time from your actual resume. You're not reading a generic answer. You're getting a response that references your specific projects, metrics, and experience, which sounds authentic and avoids the obvious 'I Googled this' tells." },
